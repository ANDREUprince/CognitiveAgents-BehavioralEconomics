key word briefly:1. Agent-based modeling: A computational modeling technique where autonomous agents with specified behaviors interact within a simulated environment to observe emergent system-level properties.
2. Economics: The study of how individuals, businesses, and societies allocate resources to meet needs and wants.
3. Predictive capabilities: The ability of a model or method to forecast or estimate future outcomes based on current data and assumptions.
4. Trade networks: Systems of interconnected economic relationships involving the exchange of goods and services between individuals, organizations, or countries.
5. Market stress: Situations where financial markets experience significant pressure or volatility due to various factors like economic uncertainty or external shocks.
6. Performance-based criteria: Standards or measures used to evaluate the effectiveness or efficiency of a system, model, or process based on its performance.
7. Utility-based criteria: Criteria used in decision-making that consider the satisfaction or benefit derived from different choices, often based on utility theory.
8. Modular design: Approach to designing systems or models by breaking them into smaller, independent modules that can be developed, tested, and modified separately.
9. Empirical accuracy: The degree to which a model or theory aligns with real-world data and observations, indicating its validity and reliability.
10. Communication: The exchange of information, ideas, or findings between individuals or groups to convey meaning and facilitate understanding.
11. Dissemination: The distribution or sharing of information, knowledge, or findings to a wider audience or community.
12. Netlogo: A multi-agent programmable modeling environment used for simulating natural and social phenomena, particularly in agent-based modeling.
13. Heterogeneity: The presence of diverse or varied elements within a system, population, or model, often used to represent different types of agents or behaviors.
14. Validation: The process of confirming the accuracy and reliability of a model, theory, or simulation by comparing its results with real-world data or observations.
15. Software distribution: The process of making software applications available to users, often involving packaging, delivery, and installation procedures.
16. Human experiments: Research studies involving human participants to investigate behaviors, preferences, or responses in controlled settings, often used for calibration in modeling.
17. Complex time series: Data sequences exhibiting intricate patterns or relationships over time, often characterized by non-linearities, trends, or irregularities.
18. Non-linearities: Situations where the relationship between variables is not proportional or additive, leading to complex and potentially unpredictable outcomes.
19. Chaotic dynamics: Behavior in dynamic systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions, leading to seemingly random or unpredictable patterns over time.
20. Heterogeneous agent models: Models in which agents have diverse characteristics, behaviors, or decision-making processes, reflecting the complexity and diversity of real-world systems.
