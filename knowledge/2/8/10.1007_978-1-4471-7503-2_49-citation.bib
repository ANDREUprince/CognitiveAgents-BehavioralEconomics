abstract="The multi-criteria character associated with making decisions entails the need for analysis and evaluation of a large amount of information and drawing conclusions on the basis of such information. Since the process is time-consuming and practically impossible to be performed by a decision-maker in real time, it is necessary to use computer decision support systems, including multi-agent systems. To support financial decision-making, the cognitive technologies can be used. These technologies support using natural language processing to sentiment analysis for the consumer ambience and to buy/sell decision-making. The aim of this chapter is to present an approach to apply cognitive architecture in a multi-agent financial decision support system. On the basis of performed researches, it can be stated that cognitive architecture allows to increase the usability of the multi-agent system and consequently to improve the process of taking investment decisions. The ability to make automatic decisions is also of high importance here. For example, the cognitive agent can make real transactions (open/close short/long position) on the Forex market.",
