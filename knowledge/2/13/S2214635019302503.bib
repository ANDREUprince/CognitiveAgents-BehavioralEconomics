abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is receiving increasing attention in business and society. In banking, the first applications of AI were successful; however, AI is mainly applied in investment banking and backend services without customer contact. AI in commercial banking with its focus on customer interaction has received little attention so far. Introducing AI in commercial banking could change business processes and interactions with customers, which could create research opportunities for behavioral finance. Based on this research gap, we conducted a structured literature review to identify applications of AI in commercial banks and the challenges of implementing AI. Our findings suggest that by using AI, commercial banks can reduce losses in lending, increase security in processing payments, automate compliance-related work, and improve customer targeting. Researchers worry about realizing technological advantages; the embedding of AI in business processes; ensuring user acceptance through transparency; privacy; and suitable documentation. Finally, we propose a research agenda for behavioral finance.}
